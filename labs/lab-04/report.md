# Lab 4: Licensing

## Why is it important to choose a license?
It's important to choose a license because without one, your code is not truly open source.  By default, a program is closed source, so licenses explicitly make them open source.  Choosing a license also lets you decide which rights you will grant to your users and which rights you will reserve.

## Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If a project does not have an explicit license, then by default the rights to that code are held by the author.  This means that if you modify the code or publish it, you can be held liable to legal action for infringing on the rights of the code's author.

## Do you agree with the `Failure to follow the open systems model` section of _Why the Web beat the Gopher_?
I do agree with the `Failure to follow the open systems model` section of _Why the Web beat the Gopher_.  One of the biggest problems Gopher had was that they did not allow the community to decide which features were necessary.  Instead, they prescribed what the community wanted.  This led to a much poorer user experience and fragmented the developers from contributing to Gopher.

## Can you justify why a license is chosen based on the history, goals, and philosophy of the project?
GPLv2 was chosen for the Linux Kernel because it is most aligned with his beliefs.  At his DebConf 14 Q/A (https://youtu.be/5PmHRSeA2c8), Linus Torvalds stated that while he initially chose a custom license for Linux, that license forbid using the kernel for commercial uses and, realizing that this would hamstring the kernel's use, he switched to GPL.  One big reason for this license's choice (as opposed to the BSD license, which Linus is also a supporter of, for example) is that it requires all modifications to be licensed under GPLv2 as well, so any improvements to the kernel produced by a fork are able to be included in the mainline kernel as well.
