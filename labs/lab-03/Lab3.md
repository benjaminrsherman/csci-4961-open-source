## Documentation
> Note: I've changed my idea about what I want to work on, so this is a new project idea.

1. I want to work on a project to track degree progress and develop a plan to take certain courses.  This would automatically generate a tree for required prerequisites as well.  This idea is similar to YACS, however instead of fitting a certain group of courses into one semester, this would be planning courses over multiple semesters.  As for technology, I want to try creating this project in Rust, as it looks like a promising language which I would like to learn and also has a WebAssembly build target.  The final goal for this project is to have a web interface for the tool, however I am going to first focus on creating a CLI version as that will be simpler.

```
$$\sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{1 + 3\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}$$
$$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}\cdots}}}$$
```
